- How to run javascript using NodeJS
- How to use NodeJS modules
- How to use specific Node JS module to read files
- How to use process to access command line arguments and the environment
- How to create a small HTTP server using Node JS
- How to create a small HTTP server using Express JS
- How to create advanced routes with Express JS
- How to use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
- How to use Nodemon to develop faster

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 20.x.x)
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the js extension
- Your code will be tested using Jest and the command npm run test
