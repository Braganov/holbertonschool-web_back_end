# Back-End Web Development Project

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on back-end web development concepts, particularly emphasizing JavaScript ES6 features and modern programming paradigms.

## Projects

### ES6 Basics (`ES6_basic/`)
Introduction to ES6 features including:
- Constants and block-scoped variables
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters and rest parameter syntax
- String interpolation
- Object property value shorthand syntax
- Computed property names
- Method properties
- For...of loops
- Iterators
- Spread syntax

### ES6 Classes (`ES6_classes/`)
Object-oriented programming in JavaScript using ES6 classes:
- Class definitions and instantiation
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Static methods
- Getters and setters
- Abstract classes (through inheritance patterns)
- Metaprogramming and Symbol usage

### ES6 Promises (`ES6_promise/`)
Asynchronous programming with Promises:
- Creating promises
- Using then, catch, and finally methods
- Handling multiple promises with Promise.all
- Error handling
- Async/await syntax
- Promise.race implementation
- Promise chaining

### ES6 Data Manipulation (`ES6_data_manipulation/`)
Working with JavaScript data structures:
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Typed arrays
- Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures
- Array search and transformation
- String manipulation
- Data processing using ES6 features

## Setup and Installation

Each project includes its own setup instructions, but generally requires:
- Node.js (version 12.11.x or higher)
- npm (to install dependencies)

For most projects:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run tests with `npm test`
4. Develop or modify code as needed

## Technologies

- JavaScript ES6+
- Node.js
- Babel (for transpilation)
- ESLint (for code quality)
- Jest (for testing)

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding modern JavaScript features and best practices
- Working with asynchronous code in JavaScript
- Implementing object-oriented designs in JavaScript
- Manipulating data structures efficiently
- Writing clean, maintainable code
