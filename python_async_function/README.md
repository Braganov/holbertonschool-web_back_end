# Python Async Function

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on async/await syntax and asyncio.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand async and await syntax
- Execute an async program with asyncio
- Run concurrent coroutines
- Create asyncio tasks
- Use the random module for asynchronous programming

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- pycodestyle 2.5.x
- All files must be executable and end with a new line
- All modules, functions, and coroutines must be properly documented
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated

## Tasks

0. Basic Async Syntax - Write an asynchronous coroutine that waits for a random delay
1. Execute Multiple Coroutines - Run multiple coroutines concurrently
2. Measure Runtime - Measure the execution time of async functions
3. Tasks - Create asyncio tasks
4. Tasks - Modify code to use tasks instead of coroutines directly
